   ```

## üì¶ Deployment

- This project is deployed on Render. You can access the live version [here](https://foodeli-frontend.onrender.com).

---

## üîç Search Functionality

- Users can search for food items by name, category, or price range.
- The search bar dynamically filters results as the user types.

**Implementation:**
- The search functionality is implemented using a combination of MongoDB queries and React state management.

---

## üì° Real-Time Updates with Socket.IO

- Admins can update the status of orders (e.g., "Out for Delivery", "Delivered").
- Users receive real-time updates on their order status without refreshing the page.

**Implementation:**
- Socket.IO is used to establish a real-time connection between the frontend and backend.
- When an admin updates an order status, the change is broadcast to all connected clients.

---

## üõë Rate Limiting

- The API is protected against abuse using rate limiting.
- Each IP address is allowed a maximum of 100 requests per 15 minutes.

**Implementation:**
- The `express-rate-limit` middleware is used to enforce rate limits on API endpoints.

---

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations

- Users receive personalized food recommendations based on their order history and the available food list.
- Recommendations are generated using OpenAI's GPT models.
- If the daily API quota is exhausted, the system falls back to random recommendations.

**Implementation:**
- The OpenAI API is used to generate recommendations.
- A fallback mechanism ensures that users always receive recommendations, even if the API quota is exhausted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Examples

### **Socket.IO Real-Time Updates**
```javascript
// Backend: Socket.IO setup
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("updateOrderStatus", (orderId, status) => {
    // Update order status in the database
    io.emit("orderStatusUpdated", orderId, status);
  });
});
```

### **Rate Limiting**
```javascript
// Backend: Rate limiting middleware
const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use(limiter);
```

### **AI-Powered Recommendations**
```javascript
// Backend: Generate recommendations
const getRecommendations = async (foodList, userHistory) => {
  try {
    const prompt = `Suggest 3 dishes from ${foodList.join(", ")} for someone who ordered ${userHistory.join(", ")}.`;
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
      max_tokens: 100,
    });
    return response.choices[0].message.content;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching recommendations:", error);
    return getFallbackRecommendations(foodList); // Fallback to random recommendations
  }
};
```
